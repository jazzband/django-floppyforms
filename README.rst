Installation
------------

* ``pip install -U django-floppyforms``
* Add ``floppyforms`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``

For those who want to mix and match with vanilla Django widgets, it is also recommended
to put Django's form template directory into your template directories::

    # in your template configuration
    TEMPLATES = [{
        ...,
        # inside the directories parameter
        'DIRS': [
            # include django's form templates
            os.path.join(
                os.path.dirname(django.__file__), "forms/templates/"
            ),
            ... # the rest of your template directories
    }]

For extensive documentation see the ``docs`` folder or `read it on
